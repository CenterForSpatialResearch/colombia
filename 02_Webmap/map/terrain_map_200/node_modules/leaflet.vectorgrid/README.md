# Leaflet.VectorGrid


Display gridded vector data (sliced [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/), [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki) or [protobuf vector tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec)) in [Leaflet](http://www.leafletjs.com) 1.0.0



## Why

Because neither Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile nor Hoverboard will work on Leaflet 1.


## Demo

With sliced GeoJSON: http://ivansanchez.github.io/Leaflet.VectorGrid/dist/demo/demo-geojson.html

With sliced TopoJSON: http://ivansanchez.github.io/Leaflet.VectorGrid/dist/demo/demo-topojson.html (sorry for the antimeridian mess, topojson-to-geojson seems to not handle it properly)

With protobuf `VectorTile`s: http://ivansanchez.github.io/Leaflet.VectorGrid/dist/demo/demo-vectortiles.html


## Using

Install through `npm` with `npm install leaflet.vectorgrid`.

This will make available some browser-ready files, which include the bundled dependencies:

* [geojson-vt](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-vt) (Under ISC license)
* [pbf](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf) (Under BSD license)
* [topojson](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson) (Under BSD license)
* [vector-tile](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-js) (Under BSD license)

Use the file `dist/Leaflet.VectorGrid.js` if you are adding these dependencies yourself, or `dist/Leaflet.VectorGrid.bundled.js` for minimal fuss.

## Docs

This plugin exposes two new classes:

### `L.VectorGrid.Slicer`

Slices some GeoJSON data into tiles, via `geojson-vt`.

Instantiate through the factory method:

```js
var layer = L.vectorGrid.slicer(geojson, options);
```

Any options to `geojson-vt` can be passed in `options`.

Styling-wise, this will create an internal vector tile layer named `sliced`. This can be overridden with the `vectorTileLayerName` option.

The slicer also accepts [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson) transparently:
```js
var layer = L.vectorGrid.slicer(topojson, options);
```

The TopoJSON format [implicitly groups features into "objects"](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson-specification/blob/master/README.md#215-objects). These will be transformed into vector tile layer names when styling (the `vectorTileLayerName` option is ignored when using TopoJSON).

### `L.VectorGrid.Protobuf`

Reads vector tiles in Protobuf (`.pbf`) format from the network.

Instantiate through the factory method:

```js
var layer = L.vectorGrid.protobuf(url, options);
```

`url` is a URL template for `.pbf` vector tiles, e.g.:

```js
var url = 'https://{s}.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/mapbox.mapbox-streets-v6/{z}/{x}/{y}.vector.pbf';
var layer = L.vectorGrid.protobuf(url, options);
```

### Styling

Vector tiles have a concept of "layer" different from the Leaflet concept of "layer".

In Leaflet, a "layer" is something that can be atomically added or removed from the map. In vector tiles, a "layer" is a named set of features (points, lines or polygons) which share a common theme.

A vector tile layer¹ can have several layers². In the `mapbox-streets-v6` vector tiles layer¹ above, there are named layers² like `admin`, `water` or `roads`.

* ¹ In leaflet
* ² Groups of themed features

Styling is done via per-layer² sets of `L.Path` options in the `vectorTileLayerStyles` layer¹ option:

```js

var vectorTileOptions = {
	vectorTileLayerStyles: {

		water: {
			weight: 0,
			fillColor: '#9bc2c4',
			fillOpacity: 1,
			fill: true
		},

		admin: function(properties, zoom) {
			var level = properties.admin_level;
			var weight = 1;
			if (level == 2) {weight = 4;}
			return {
				weight: weight,
				color: '#cf52d3',
				dashArray: '2, 6',
				fillOpacity: 0
			}
		},

		road: []
	}
};

At this time, only polylines and polygons can be styled. There is no support (yet) for symbolizing points.


var pbfLayer = L.vectorGrid.protobuf(url, vectorTileOptions).addTo(map);
```

A layer² style can be either:
* A set of `L.Path` options
* An array of sets of `L.Path` options
* A function that returns a set of `L.Path` options
* A function that returns an array of sets of `L.Path` options

Layers² with no style specified will use the default `L.Path` options.


### SVG vs `<canvas>`

Leaflet.VectorGrid is able to render vector tiles with both SVG and `<canvas>`, in the same way that vanilla Leaflet can use SVG and `<canvas>` to draw lines and polygons.

To switch between the two, use the `rendererFactory` option for any `L.VectorGrid` layer, e.g.:

```js
var sliced = L.vectorGrid.slicer(geojson, {
	rendererFactory: L.svg.tile,
	attribution: 'Something',
	vectorTileLayerStyles: { ... }
});

var pbf = L.vectorGrid.protobuf(url, {
	rendererFactory: L.canvas.tile,
	attribution: 'Something',
	vectorTileLayerStyles: { ... }
});
```

Internally, Leaflet.VectorGrid uses two classes named `L.SVG.Tile` and `L.Canvas.Tile`, with factory methods `L.svg.tile` and `L.canvas.tile` - a `L.VectorGrid` needs to be passed one of those factory methods.


## Dependencies

`L.VectorGrid.Slicer` requires `geojson-vt`: the global variable `geojsonvt` must exist. If topojson data is used, then the `topojson` global variable must also exist.

`L.VectorGrid.Protobuf` requires `vector-tile` and `pbf`: the global variables `VectorTile` and `Pbf` must exist.

## Developing

Run `npm install`, then run the `aux/browserify-dependencies.sh` script. The dependencies do not provide browser-ready packages, see for example [mapbox/geojson-vt#52](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-vt/pull/52).

## TODO

* Sub-panes for the tile renderers (to set the "z-index" of layers/features)
 * More `<g>`roups in SVG
 * Offscreen `<canvas>`es in Canvas
* `getBounds()` support for the slicer (inherit/extrapolate from geojson data)
* Symbolize points somehow
